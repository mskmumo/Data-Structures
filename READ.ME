I've created a complete implementation of a singly linked list in Java with all the requested methods. Let me explain the key components of the implementation:
    Node Class: A private static inner class that represents each node in the linked list. Each node contains:
    data: The integer value stored in the node
    next: Reference to the next node in the list
Main Methods:
        insertAtBeginning(int data): Inserts a new node at the beginning of the list
        insertAtEnd(int data): Inserts a new node at the end of the list
        deleteFromBeginning(): Deletes the first node from the list
Helper Methods:
    display(): Prints the linked list for visualization
    Constructor: Initializes an empty linked list
Main Method: Includes test cases to demonstrate the functionality of all methods
                The program includes proper error handling (like checking for empty lists) and follows Java best practices. When you run this program, it will:
                Create a new linked list
                Insert nodes at the beginning (3, 2, 1)
                Insert nodes at the end (4, 5)
                Delete a node from the beginning
                Display the list after each operation
